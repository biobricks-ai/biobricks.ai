<h1>The Genotype-Tissue Expression <a href="https://gtexportal.org/home/documentationPage">GTEx</a> project</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to provide to the scientific community a resource with which to study human gene expression and regulation and its relationship to genetic variation. This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who are also densely genotyped, to assess genetic variation within their genomes. By analyzing global RNA expression within individual tissues and treating the expression levels of genes as quantitative traits, variations in gene expression that are highly correlated with genetic variation can be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs.</p>

<p><code>flair_filter_transcripts.parquet</code> &gt; All transcripts (annotated and novel) identified using FLAIR. We first combined all samples, before filtering reads with respect to existing transcription start sites, and filtering the final set using transdecoder. The columns of this file are in <a href="http://useast.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html">GTF</a> format. - seqname. Name of the chromosome or scaffold. - source. Name of the program that generated this feature. - feature. Feature type name, e.g. Gene, Variation, Similarity. - start. Start position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1. - end. End position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1. - score. The score field indicates a degree of confidence in the feature's existence and coordinates. The value of this field has no global scale but may have relative significance when the <source> field indicates the prediction program used to create this annotation. It may be a floating point number or integer, and not necessary and may be replaced with a dot. - strand. Defined as + (forward) or - (reverse). - phase. The frame in a codon (if applicable) to which the base pair correspond. - attribute. A semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs, providing additional information about each feature.</p>
